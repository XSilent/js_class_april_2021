# AppsScript example

This is the adapted example from session 3/8, were we ran the code in the browser, embedded into a HTML file. 
Now this example is modified to match with Google AppsScript requirements.

# Where to run this code?

1. Open a new Google sheet, eg by calling this url: http://sheets.new
2. Go to menu "tools" -> "script editor"
3. Paste the entire code (including function) into the editor, entirely replacing the existing function
4. Save it
5. Run it: by clicking on the "play" button
6. Switch back to the browser tab containing the Google sheet and interact with the number guessing game
